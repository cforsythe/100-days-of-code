The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on March 12, Tuesday, 2019.

## Log

### R1D1 
Started on my own online portfolio. Mainly took most time getting the environment set up and making angular auto refresh page when making a code change

### R1D2
Added to online portfolio, it's still pretty basic but I got a navbar working with anchors now. Stuck trying to get css to load an asset

### R1D3
Now I have my home image working and scaling based on view size. So it *should* be mobile friendly, but that will come later. Adding headshot tomorrow
