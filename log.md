# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: March 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started an angular app for an online portfolio

**Thoughts**: Initial setup was weird because app would not auto refresh upon a save, figured out angular has a polling option, ready to start getting some actual page development done.

### Day 1: March 13, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on my angular portfolio and got navbar working with anchors 

**Thoughts**: Navbar was easy to setup but figuring anchors out took a long time. Currently trying to figure out how to get angular to serve a static image using css, im stuck.
